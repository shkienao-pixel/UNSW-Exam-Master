# Codex + Cursor Session Bootstrap (Paste this at the start of EVERY new Codex chat)

You are working inside my repository.

0) Non-negotiables
- Always follow constraints in repo root PROJECT_CONTEXT.md.
- Never couple Quiz/Flashcards/Study/Mistakes state in one page; keep each feature as separate pages/routes.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped; avoid unrelated refactors.

1) First action in this session
- Open and read: ./PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- Then respond with:
  a) A concise restatement of the TOP 10 constraints/requirements (bulleted)
  b) Any risks/ambiguities you notice (max 5 bullets)
  c) A plan for the requested task with acceptance checks

2) Working style
- Before coding: confirm which files you will change.
- While coding: implement smallest diff that satisfies requirements.
- After coding: provide:
  - changed files list
  - key diffs summary
  - manual test checklist matching PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

3) If context is large / compacted
- Re-open PROJECT_CONTEXT.md and re-derive constraints before continuing.
