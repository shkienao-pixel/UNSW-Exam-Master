## 1. Functional Testing Checklist
Before marking a task as "Complete", verify:
- [ ] **Upload Test:** Upload a PDF > 10MB. Does it crash?
- [ ] **Empty Test:** Click "Generate Quiz" without uploading a file. Does it show a warning or crash?
- [ ] **Reset Test:** If I refresh the page, does the API Key stay? (It should if coded correctly).

## 2. Content Quality Checks (The "UNSW Standard")
- **Hallucination Check:** Does the summary mention concepts NOT in the source text?
- **Tone Check:** Is the language academic? (Avoid slang like "Cool stuff", use "Significant findings").
- **Formatting:** Are mathematical formulas rendered nicely using LaTeX? (e.g., $E = mc^2$).

## 3. Code Review Guidelines
- **Security:** Are API keys printed to the console? (Reject if yes).
- **Efficiency:** Is the text chunk size appropriate? (Should be ~1000 tokens for RAG).
- **Modularity:** Can I reuse the `QuizGenerator` class in another app?

## 4. Final User Acceptance
- Imagine you are a stressed student 2 days before the final exam.
- Is the UI intuitive?
- Is the "Generate" button visible immediately?
