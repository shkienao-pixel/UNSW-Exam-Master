## 1. Functional Testing Checklist
Before marking a task as "Complete", verify:
- [ ] **Upload Test:** Upload a PDF > 10MB. Does it crash?
- [ ] **Empty Test:** Click "Generate Quiz" without uploading a file. Does it show a warning or crash?
- [ ] **Reset Test:** If I refresh the page, does the API Key stay? (It should if coded correctly).

## 2. Content Quality Checks (The "UNSW Standard")
- **Hallucination Check:** Does the summary mention concepts NOT in the source text?
- **Tone Check:** Is the language academic? (Avoid slang like "Cool stuff", use "Significant findings").
- **Formatting:** Are mathematical formulas rendered nicely using LaTeX? (e.g., $E = mc^2$).

## 3. Code Review Guidelines
- **Security:** Are API keys printed to the console? (Reject if yes).
- **Efficiency:** Is the text chunk size appropriate? (Should be ~1000 tokens for RAG).
- **Modularity:** Can I reuse the `QuizGenerator` class in another app?

## 4. Final User Acceptance
- Imagine you are a stressed student 2 days before the final exam.
- Is the UI intuitive?
- Is the "Generate" button visible immediately?

## 5. Phase 2.2 Dashboard QA (Portal-style IA)

### Status Checklist
- [x] Added default landing page `Dashboard` with navigation to `Study/Exam`
- [x] Existing `Study` and `Exam` render functions kept and still routable
- [x] Dashboard hero shows app/schema/lang/collection
- [x] Dashboard actions wired:
  - Upload PDFs -> Study
  - Build/Refresh Index -> shared index build handler
  - Start Exam -> Exam
- [x] Updates section reads latest `CHANGELOG.md` entries
- [x] Activity section shows last index/export/collection fields with empty-state tips
- [x] Need Help section includes rebuild/migration/self-check guidance
- [x] i18n keys added for new dashboard labels/buttons
- [ ] Manual visual QA on desktop/mobile completed (pending human verification)

### Evidence (Commands)
1. Syntax check:
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile src/app.py src/i18n.py
```
Result: pass (no compile errors).

2. Stability self-check:
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/self_check.py
```
Result log:
```text
self_check: OK
```

3. Implementation trace:
```powershell
rg -n "def _render_dashboard|nav_page|selected_collection|_get_changelog_preview|_run_index_build|last_index_build_time|last_export_time" src/app.py
```
Result: functions/state hooks present with expected matches.

### Evidence (Manual Click Paths)
1. `Dashboard` -> click `Upload PDFs` -> routes to `Study Mode`.
2. `Dashboard` -> click `Start Exam` -> routes to `Exam Simulator`.
3. `Dashboard` -> click `Build/Refresh Vector Index` with no cached uploads -> warning shown.
4. `Sidebar > Navigation` toggle between `Dashboard/Study/Exam` -> correct page content renders.
5. `Sidebar > Collection` change value -> Dashboard metric `selected collection` updates.
